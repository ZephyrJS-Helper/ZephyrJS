<h2>Looking to Help?</h2>
<p>If you'd like to help out, there's a few ways that you can!</p>
<dl>
<dt>Bug Reports/Feature Requests</dt>
<dd>If you'd like to directly influence where I'll be focusing my efforts, <a href="https://github.com/ZephyrJS-Project/ZephyrJS/issues">submit an issue on Github</a>! It'll get added to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ZephyrJS-Project/projects/1">project board</a>, and you can track the progress there!</dd>
<dt>Usage Poll</dt>
<dd>For broader information, you can fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/hfR5pmJY9g51RPRL8">the usage poll</a>. It just has some general questions about PixiJS and should only take a couple minutes to fill out, but it is very useful.</dd>
<dt>Contribute Directly</dt>
<dd>Code is always welcome, just I'd appreciate some communication beforehand, or VERY well documented code. </dd>
<dd>I'm also looking for someone who is experienced with creating/maintaining NPM packages to extend Zephyr's reach!</dd>
