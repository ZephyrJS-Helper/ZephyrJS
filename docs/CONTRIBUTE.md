<h2>Looking to Help?</h2>
<p>If you'd like to help out, there's a few ways that you can!</p>
<dl>
<dt>Bug Reports/Feature Requests</dt>
<dd>If you'd like to directly influence where I'll be focusing my efforts, <a href="https://github.com/ZephyrStudio/ZephyrJS/issues">submit an issue on Github</a>! It'll get added to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ZephyrStudio/projects/1">project board</a>, and you can track the progress there!</dd>
<dt>Contribute Directly</dt>
<dd>Code is always welcome, we prefer to have communication beforehand, or VERY well documented code.</dd>
<dd>We're also looking for someone who is experienced with creating/maintaining NPM packages to extend Zephyr's reach!</dd>
