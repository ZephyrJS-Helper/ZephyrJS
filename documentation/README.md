<h1>ZephyrJS | Documentation</h1>
  <p>Zephyr is designed to extend the functionality of <span id="compatibility">PixiJS</span>, rather than wrapping it so that you can always use Pixi without Zephyr.</p>
  <p>The <span class="return">Return</span> line below the function indicates the object type that is returned.</p>
  <p>The <span class="nightly">Nightly Exclusive</span> features can only be found in the current nightly version of Zephyr. Consider trying it out, and letting us know of any bugs you find!</p>
  <p>The <span class="deprecated">Deprecated</span> features are set to be removed in the next stable release.</p>

  <h2>PIXI.Keys</h2>
  <p>keyName is a string that is returned by keyboardEvent.code. Check out my <a href="keyName.html">Key Namer</a> to get specific key names</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>PIXI.Keys.down(keyName)</dt>
    <dd>Returns true if the key is actively pressed down.</dd>

    <dd><strong class="nightly">NOTE</strong>: There has been a bug report about passing in an element that hasn't been appended to the DOM. This has been addressed in Nightly version 22.12.26, and will be going into Stable in Zephyr 23.1. If not using one of these versions, please ensure your mouse container has been appended to the DOM BEFORE setting it as the mouse container.</dd>

  <h2>PIXI.Audio</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>PIXI.Audio.from(src)</dt>

    <dt>PIXI.File.open()</dt>
    <dd>Prompts the user to select a file, which it then attempts to parse as JSON and return</dd>
    <dd class="return">Object</dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>PIXI.collision</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>PIXI.collision.aabb(Sprite, Sprite)</dt>
