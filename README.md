<h1 class="zephyr">ZephyrJS | Welcome!</h1>
<p><strong>Expands <a href="https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs">PixiJS</a> for easy interactive projects!</strong></p>
</header>

<p class="pixi" id="compatibility"></p>

<h2>Tell Me Why</h2>
<p>PixiJS on its own is very powerful, but a lot of work is needed to make it work for web-based interactive content. PhaserIO is exclusively used to make games, and not all of the functionality is translatable back to Pixi. ZephyrJS is for more than just games, made to be usable with user-interactive projects of any sort. It also directly ADDS to PixiJS instead of wrapping it, letting you use the full functionality of Pixi so that what you've gotten used to can still be used outside of Zephyr.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Please note that it is REQUIRED that you include the script tag for PixiJS before the script tag for ZephyrJS.</p>

<p>Most projects should just use the monthly <a href="https://github.com/ZephyrJS-Helper/ZephyrJS/releases">Github Releases</a>, as the latest tested-compatible version of PixiJS is included with each one.</p>

<p>If you don't want to download Pixi/Zephyr, use the following code to use the hosted <strong>stable release</strong>. Please note that some specs WILL change at the start of every month when a new version is released, but this is a great way to test out Zephyr for projects without committing to using it.</p>
<p><code>&lt;script src="https://zephyrjs.netlify.app/stable/pixi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;script src="https://zephyrjs.netlify.app/stable/zephyr.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>This will always use the latest stable-tested version of (minified, speed matters) Pixi/Zephyr.</p>
<p>If you're willing to help out development by reporting bugs and issues, consider using the <strong class="zephyr">nightly release</strong>!</p>
<p><code>&lt;script src="https://zephyrjs.netlify.app/nightly/pixi.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;script src="https://zephyrjs.netlify.app/nightly/zephyr.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>Please do bear in mind that things ARE likely to break in functionality, especially right after a new release of Pixi.</p>
