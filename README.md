<h1>What is ZephyrJS?</h1>

<p>ZephyrJS is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project that aims to provide <strong>a simple yet powerful expansion of <a href="https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs">PixiJS</a> for powerful web game development, without wrapping</strong>. Since the team behind Pixi is devoted to making the fastest web renderer around, Zephyr adds onto it by supplying commonly used features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>efficient mouse and keyboard input tracking</li>
<li>an easy-to-use implementation of the WebAudio API</li>
<li>fine-tunable particle emitters</li>
<li>and much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>Since Zephyr is an expansion (not a wrapper), every feature is written to feel right at home amongst PixiJS' other features.

<h2>Zephyr is Open-Source</h2>

<p>Because it makes sense: Zephyr is FOSS because Pixi is. It doesn't make sense to charge developers when they're creating their own projects, and why shouldn't they be able to tweak Zephyr to better fit their needs? Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) is all about letting people choose what they want to use, and wrapping all of PixiJS just to add game development tools just hides the work of the team behind it. Zephyr <strong>adds</strong> functionality to PixiJS instead of wrapping it, allowing developers to work with the PixiJS they know and love while also letting them use fast and efficient game engine features.</p>

<h1>Why Zephyr?</h1>

<p>Web-based content has been providing a way to access all sorts of entertainment, and being able to game on the web is the next step. While flash games existed in the past, browsers didn't have the kind of power to run full games. They do now though, and browsers have been able to directly leverage the available hardware to speed up rendering for some time now. PixiJS does this by using the WebGL API, letting anybody have access to the fast web renderer around.</p>

<p>There are so many PixiJS game engine wrappers out there, but that's not Zephyr's goal. Pixi's team has provided incredible documentation and examples, so why re-engineer all of them? The ZephyrJS project adds the game engine features developers need, and doesn't touch what it shouldn't. Because of this, the Zephyr project only maintains documentation for its added features, meaning updates can get released faster while staying compatibile with the latest and greatest of versions of Pixi.</p>
