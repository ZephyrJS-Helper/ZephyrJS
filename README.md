<h2>FOSS Game Development Features for PixiJS</h2>

<p>ZephyrJS expands PixiJS with free and open-source game engine features, so that developers don't have to learn a a new system that is just a wrapper for PixiJS. Zephyr adds to it instead of wrapping, so that developers using PixiJS always have the <strong>option</strong> to use Zephyr.</p>

<p>Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) is all about letting people choose what they want to use, and wrapping all of Pixi just to add game development tools doesn't make a lot of sense. PixiJS is the fastest web renderer with incredible documentation and examples, so why re-engineer all the great things that the Pixi team does? The ZephyrJS project only maintains its own documentation, so we can get updates out faster and give you the latest and greatest of Pixi.</p>

<h2>Why Zephyr?</h2>

<p>Web-based content has been providing a way to access all sorts of entertainment, and being able to game on the web is the next step. While flash games existed in the past, browsers didn't have the kind of power to run full games. But now they do, and browsers have been able to directly use the available hardware to speed up rendering for some time now. ZephyrJS is an expansion of the fastest, most flexible 2D WebGL renderer <a href="https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs" class="pixi">PixiJS</a>, letting anybody have access to a blazing fast renderer with standard game engine features that developers have come to rely on.</p>

<p>And ZephyrJS is <strong>quick</strong> to setup and use. After following PixiJS's standard setup, it only takes <strong>one line of code</strong> to add Zephyr. No more installing packages, no more trying to figure out which plugins you need, just add ZephyrJS and you're all set up. Call Zephyr's initializing functions for the features you need (Mouse/Keyboard handling, WebAudio interface, Particles, etc) and you're ready code!</p>
